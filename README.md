# OUTSPACE

Final Project - Cart 263


![First Sketch](https://github.com/Alouux/CART-263/blob/main/Sketches/Screen%20Shot%202024-04-21%20at%205.04.33%20PM.png?raw=true)

## Description

A stop motion animation plays as you enter the play screen. A friendly alien, **Luna** (AKA you) is ambushed by Cosmic critters and is pulled from her ship. Drifting through the depths of space, the only hope for survival is to collect the remnants of the space craft.

The game takes place over the course of **3 levels ** that increase in difficulty. Scattered about are moons for the player to collect as a bonus to add to their score. 

I initally had a very ambitious concept for this game. The initial concept in my final proposal stated there would be 4 levels with a boss fight (allowing the player movement integration such as a dash feature) though, I did not have all the capacity to do so within the time constraint. Still, I would love to fletch out the game on my own time as the few people who play tested the game genuinely enjoyed the difficulty behind the movement and the increasing difficulty. I could invision this game having many sets of levels with different back drop styles, increasing the mob abilities as the levels progress.

The boss level featuring the Regolith could sadly not be implemented in this iteration with the current knowledge I have using Phaser. Though I am learning more each day and with each iteraiton it becomes more cohesive.
